# Custom Hooks

### What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?
Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. These methods are 
- `componentDidMount()`
- `componentDidUpdate()`
- `componentWillUnmount()`
- `componentDidCatch()`
### Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect
`useEffect` allows to register a function that runs after the current render cycle which runs after every render cycle. However, this may cause an infinite loop. This is where
`useCallback` is used.By wrapping `useCallback` around the function, and defining the dependencies of the function, it makes the `useEffect` to run only if the dependencies 
are changed.
### Why are functional components preferred over class components?
A functional component is written shorter and simpler, which makes it easier to develop, understand, and test.
### What is wrong with the following code?
```JavaScript
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```
Hooks are meant to be on at the top level and shouldn't be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. However the code above has a for loop before `useEffect`.

### state hook
State hooks are hooks in react that declares a state variable and updates the state.
### effect hook
Effect hooks allow to perform side effects in function components such as life cycle methods for class components.
### reducer hook
An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. useReducer is usually 
preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you 
optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
