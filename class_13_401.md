# Message Queues

### What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
It means the the user can send a message and the other side can recieve a message. This is different from previous HTTP since HTTP could only perfrom request-response. It can
also be used when the sever wants to push a lot of data and frequently update the browser such as multiplayer games or chat services.

### Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
Yes. socket.io is not simply a websocket library. It is a bidirectinoal event-based communication library. It does use websockets but has other functionalities such as 
segmentation, acknowledgements, and broadcasts. In addition, socket.io has the inital connection setup done over HTTP.

### What happens when a client emits an event?
The server listens to the event and reacts accordingly.
### What happens when a server emits an event?
When the server emits an event, based on where the event is directed to the corresponding client responds.
### What happens if a client “misses” an event?
Unhandled events become ignored.
### How can we mitigate this?
In order to see if there are events that are missed, we can give events incremental ids to check if they are being missed. Or it can also be done by getting the list of callbacks
from the socket internal and compare it to the incoming event header on the client side.


### Socket
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the 
application that data is destined to be sent to.
### Web Socket
The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API,
you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
### Socket.io
Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
### Client
A client is a computer application, such as a web browser, that runs on a user's local computer, smartphone, or other device, and connects to a server as necessary.
### Server
A server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices.
### OSI Model
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes 
computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.
- Application layer
- Presentation layer
- Session layer
- Transport layer
- Network layer
- Data Link layer
- Physical layer
### TCP Model
The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model.
- Application layer
- Transport layer
- Internet layer
- Network Access layer
### TCP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation through which application programs can exchange data.
### UDP
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications 
on the internet.
### Packets
A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination 
as well as the content (or data) being transferred.
