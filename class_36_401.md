### What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
Cookies are primarily for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side. Cookies give you a limit of 4096 bytes (4095, actually) — it's per cookie. 
Local Storage is as big as 5MB per domain. Cookies have legacy support, persistent data, and expiration dates. Local storage is supported by most modern browsers, persistent data
 that is stored directly in the browser, is not sent with every HTTP request.
 
### Explain 3rd party cookies.
Third-party cookies are tracking codes that are placed on a web visitor's computer after being generated by another website other than your own. When a web visitor visits your 
site and others, the third-party cookie tracks this information and sends it to the third-party who created the cookie -- which might be an advertiser.

### How do pixel tags work?
A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Because it is so 
small, it can hardly be seen by visitors of a website or email recipients. These tracking pixels are partly or fully designed to be transparent, or camouflaged in the 
background color of the website so that they don't stand out to users. Users are usually not supposed to see the tracking pixel. The focus is mainly on the processes 
that are initiated by downloading the tracking pixel.
