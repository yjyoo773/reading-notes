# `<Login />` and `<Auth />`

### Why is the Context API useful?
It allows to pass/upddate data and state among components much easier especially for sibling components.
### Can a component outside of a provider get its context?
No.
### What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
When changing universal settings within the application such as the UI theme of the application. 
### Describe “Context Hell”
When there are too many nested context APIs. Similar to callback hell when one function calls another, when each component is continuosly a provider/consumer.

### global state
A state managed at the top level component. This can be accessesd from anywhere within the application as long as it is being passed on.
### global context
Context that is managed at the top level of the application. Can be accessed as long as consumer imports it.
### provider
Component that is providing the context to components that are wrapped within the provider.
### consumer
Component that is using the context provided from the provider. Must be within the provider.
