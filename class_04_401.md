# Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion
### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Siginificant reductions in defect rates at the cost of a moderate increase in development effort
- Overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects' final phase
- Improved design qualitities in the code, and a higher degree of internal of technical quality
### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
`beforeEach()` can be used when before testing there needs to be something initialized with what is to be tested. The `afterEach()` occurs after the test which can be used to
reset changed code. `beforeEach()` can also be used when clearing shared state if the test runs as a larger suite and that a different test is interfering with the current one.
### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- TDD is time consuming and costlye since a significant time is spend on refactoring and rewriting code.
- TDD focuses on passing tests which is not exactly the same as correctness. => incorrect test --> bad result
### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
The difference between ES6 Classes and a protoype-based inheritance class is a class defines a *type* which can be instantiated at runtime. A prototype is itself an object instance.
### Why REST?
Benefits of REST is that they are flexibile. Data isn't tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and change structurally
with the correct implementation of hypermedia. With this flexibility building APIs are possible for various needs.

## Vocab Terms
### functional programming
Binding everything in pure mathematical functions style. Its main purpose is what to solve.  
Benefits:
- easier to understand since states donot change and depend on give input
- code it more readable
- testing and debugging is easier
- used to implement concurrency/parallelism since pure functions don't change variables
- adopts lazy evaluation which avoids repeated evaluation
Drawbacks:
- can reduce readability of code
- writing programs in recursive style instead of loops can be intimidating
- combining pure functions with rest of application and I/O can be difficult

### object-oriented programming (OOP)
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, 
reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. 
### class
In object-oriented programming, a class defines an object's characteristics. Class is a template definition of an object's properties and methods, the "blueprint" from 
which other more specific instances of the object are drawn.
### super
When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. The super keyword can also be used to call functions 
on a parent object.
### this
A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in non–strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.  
`this` varies on the situation
- In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object whether in strict mode or not.
- Function not 'strict mode' `this` will default to the global object
- Function 'strict mode' `this` will be undefined
- In arrow functions, `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context's this. In global code, it will be set to the global object
- When a function is called as a method of an object, its `this` is set to the object the method is called on.
### Test Driven Development (TDD)
“Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) 
and design (in the form of refactoring).
### Jest
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework built by Facebook and primarily designed for React-based applications, but is also used with Babel, JavaScript, Node, Angular, and Vue. 
It can be used to test NestJS and GraphQL
### Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each 
integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.
### REST
Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. 
A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.
### Data Model
Data modeling (data modelling) is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. This data model is a conceptual representation of Data 
objects, the associations between different data objects, and the rules. Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, 
regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while
ensuring quality of the data.
