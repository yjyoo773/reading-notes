# Access Control (ACL)

## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
*Basic authentication*   
Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP 
requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string 
username:password.   
*Bearer authentication*   
Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security 
tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The 
bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this 
token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

## What does the JSON Web Token package do?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting 
information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs 
can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
The SECRET should always be stored in the `.env` and when creating the secret should at least be 32 characters long, but the longer the better.

## Vocab
### encryption
Encryption is a process that encodes a message or file so that it can be only be read by certain people. Encryption uses an algorithm to scramble, or encrypt, data and 
then uses a key for the receiving party to unscramble, or decrypt, the information.
### token
a series of bits that circulate on a token-ring network. When one of the systems on the network has the "token," it can send information 
to the other computers.
### bearer
“Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.”
### secret
The secret key is combined with the header and the payload to create a unique hash. Only the user that has the secret key can verify the hash.
