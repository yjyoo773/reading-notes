# Express

## Review, Research, and Discussion
### What’s the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?
 - For a `PUT` request the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server and the client is requesting that the stored version
 be replaced.
 - `PATCH` the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version. It affects the resource identified by the Request-URI.
### Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
- https://miragejs.com/
- https://jestjs.io/
- https://www.cypress.io/

### Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
- apiDoc.js  
apiDoc.js creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated api_data.js and api_project.js as a html page
- Swagger  
Swagger is a free cloud based API testing and documentation tool to simplfy the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.

### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
**SOAP**  
- It stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
- SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionanlity to client applications
- SOAP needs more bandwith for its usage
- Only works with XML formats
- Cannot make use of REST
- Use when => asynchronous processing and subsequent invocation, formal means of communication, and stateful operations

**REST**
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer
- It is an architectural pattern
- REST uses Uniform Service locatroes to access to the components on the hardware device
- REST doesn't need much bandwidth
- REST work with plain text, XML, HTML, and JSON
- REST can make use of SOAP
- Use when => limited resource and bandwidth, statelessness, caching, and ease of coding

## Node and Express
*Node* is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows to create server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.  
**Benefits**
- Has great performance in which is a good solution for many common web-development problems
- Code is written in JavaScript hence, less time being spient with language changes between client and server side
- JavaScript being a newer language has benefits from improvements
- `npm` provides numerous packages and has best in-class dependency resolution
- Available in many operating systems
- Has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community  

*Express* is the most popular Node web framework and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.  
It provides  
- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different url routes
- Integrate with 'view' rendering engines in order to generate responses by iserting data into templates
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response
- Add additional request processing 'middleware' at any point within the request handling pipeline

## `npm`
=> Largest software registry.  
Consists of: 
- website: use to discover packages, set up profile, and manage `npm` experience
- CLI: runs from the terminal to interact iwth `npm` 
- registry: a larget public databse of JS software and meta-information surrounding the software

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Write single unit test describing on an aspect of the program
- Run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
- Write simplest form of code to pass test
- Refactor code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria
- Repeat accumulating unit tests

**Benefits**  
- Siginificant reductions in defect rates at the cost of a moderate increase in development effort
- Overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects' final phase
- Improved design qualitities in the code, and a higher degree of internal of technical quality

## CI/CD
#### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Ensure everyone's change integrates into main branch
- Catch bugs
- Reduce merge conflicts
When new work is added to branch, server tests code if it works and can integrate to main development branch. 
#### Continous Delivery(CD)
Develop to release at any time
#### Continuous Deployment
Deploy new features immediately

## Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?   
I have a better understanding of CI/CD, TDD, and how significant Express is.
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?  
I am still having trouble understanding what SOAP, apiDoc.js, and Swagger is.
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?  
I am eager to learn more of CI/CD as going through job descriptions it pops out a lot and getting to know how to use it will make me more marketable.
