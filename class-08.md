# APIs

## Super Agent
a light weight progressive ajax API for flexibility, readability, and lower learning curve.

### Request Basic
A request can be initiated with the appropriate method on the `request` object such as `get` `post` `put` `delete`.  
Then calling `.then()` or `.end()` to esnd the request.
```JavaScript
 request
   .get('/search')
   .then(res => {
      // res.body, res.headers, res.status
   })
   .catch(err => {
      // err.message, err.response
   });
```
- **GET**: called by `.get()` when used with the `.query()` accepts and object. Forming a query string.
- **POST/PUT**:  sends/updates data. ==> write data
```JavaScript
  request.post('/user')
    .send({ name: 'tj', pet: 'tobi' })
    .then(callback, errorCallback)
```
- **DELETE**: uses `.del()` which deletes data.

## Regex
Used to parse/replace strings passing through data ane web scraping.

### Anchors

abc{2}      matches a string that has ab followed by 2 c
abc{2,}     matches a string that has ab followed by 2 or more c
abc{2,5}    matches a string that has ab followed by 2 up to 5 c
a(bc)*      matches a string that has a followed by zero or more copies of the sequence bc
a(bc){2,5}  matches a string that has a followed by 2 up to 5 copies of the sequence bc
```

### Character Classes
