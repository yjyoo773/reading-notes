### Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one 
"single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The term comes from 
the mathematical concept of a singleton.


### Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project. 
It is used where only a single instance of a class is required to control the action throughout the execution. A singleton class 
shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost. Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, 
caching and thread pool, database connections.

### If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
Firstly, think of what the middlewares is going to be used for and to check if it will be used globally or for a certain route.


## Vocab Terms
### Router Middleware
A router middleware is a middleware on the router level. Unlike a application level middleware it is used on a specific route.
### Dynamic Module Loading
Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, 
retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, 
and unload the library from memory.

### Mock Testing
Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other 
system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. 
The purpose of mocking is to isolate and focus on the code being tested and not on the behaviour or state of external dependencies.
