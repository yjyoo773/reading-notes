## How to Solve Programming Problems

1. Read the problem twice to understand the question
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
6. Optimize the real code
==> 70% of time should be spent on steps 1-3

### Solve the Problem Manually
Need to be able to solve problem manually in order to automate it. Being able to solve the problem manually lets you know what to automate.  
Won't be able to solve during a programming interview and look like an idiot. Also, check for corner/edge cases.

### Optimize Manual Solution
Worth trying to optimize the actual solution/simplify it when it is the most easily malleable state. Figure if there is an easier way to solve it.

### Write Pseudo-Code or Comments
Capture all the steps and put them into pseudo-code to translate into real code.

### Replace Comments with Real Code
If having difficulty, may need to study more on the language that is being used
- Create List
- Sort list or array
- Create map or dictionary
- Loop through list or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert string to int, int to string

### Optimize Code
Naming variables meaningful names, and simplify code by removing dups.

## How to Think Like a Programmer

### Have a Framework
#### Understand
Know what is being asked. => Write down the problem and doodle the diagram.
#### Plan
Plan out the solution. Analyze the problem and think out how you are going to solve the problem
#### Divide
Break the problem into steps. Then solve each step and connect the dots to solve the original problem.
#### Stuck?
- Debug: go step by step of the problem and find what is wrong.
- Reassess: look at the problem at a different angle. 
- Research: look at other solutions and study them.

#### Practice
Put time and effort on solving. Practice solving code challenges, or frankly any type of challenge.

## 5 Whys
**When a problem occurs, drill down to its root cause by asking 'why' five times**

### When to Use 5 Whys
This technique can be used for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving. 

### How to use 5 Whys
1. Assemble a Team  
Gather people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone who can 
keep the team focus on identifying effective counter-measures
2. Define the Problem  
Observe the problem in action. Discuss with the team and write a brief, clear problem statement that all agree on.
3. Ask the First "Why"  
Ask why the problem is occurring. Search for answers that are grounded in fact --> account of things that have actually happened, not things that might have happened
4. Ask "Why" 4 More Times  
For each answer generated from 3rd step, ask four further "why" in succession
5. Know When to Stop  
When the "whys" no longer produce meaningful responses is an appropriate time to stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)  
Now that the team has identified at least one root cause, discuss and agree on counter-measures to prevent problem from recurring
7. Monitor Your Measures 
Monitor on how effectively the counter-measures eliminate/minimize the problem. Can be amended or replaced if needed.
