# Redux - Combined Reducers

### Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
Context API prompts a re-render on each update of the state and re-renders all components regardless. Redux however, only re-renders the updated components. Making it ideal for 
larger applications with high-frequency state updates.

### What does an action contain?
 Actions have a type field that tells what kind of action to perform and all other fields contain information or data. And there is one other term called Action Creators, 
 these are the function that creates actions. So actions are the information (Objects) and action creator are functions that return these actions.


### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
This is because in redux, state is read-only. It is essential because all the changes are happening in the same place so everything is needed to be done in strict order one by one.

### immutable state
State that cannot be changed.

### time travel in redux
Time travel debugging refers to the ability step forward and backward through the state of you application, empowering the developer understand exactly what is happening at any 
point in the app’s lifecycle.

### action creator
These are the function that creates actions. So actions are the information (Objects) and action creator are functions that return these actions.

### reducer
Actions only tell what to do, but they don’t tell how to do, so reducers are the pure functions that take the current state and action and return the new state 
and tell the store how to do.

### dispatch
To change the state.
