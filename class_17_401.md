# AWS: S3 and Lambda

### Describe “The Cloud”
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data 
centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider. 

### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments regardless of environment.
 They are a powerful way for developers to package and deploy their applications. As containers are lightweight and provide consistent, portable software environment for applications 
 to easily run and scale anywhere moving applications into cloud are one of the popular usages for containers.

### What is auto-scaling?
Autoscaling is monitoring applications and automatically adjusting its capacity that are in the cloud. By doing so it maintains steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible
 cost for users.

### What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is the volume of data handled and _the transmission rate of data across a network_. Cloud computing providers calculate the required bandwidth of customers by considering 
the available quantity of bandwidth as well as the mean bandwidth utilization needed for various applications which can also be related to **auto-scaling**. 

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?
Prices for cloud services are influenced by
- The lease period, which can be considered as the contract time between the provider and the customer.
- The initial cost of the resources
- The rate of depreciation, which means how many time these resources are being used
- The quality of service
- The age of the resources
- The cost of Maintenance
Based on the above, the price can be set either on the pay-per-use model, subscription, or a combination of the two.

#### Server Instances
A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance 
can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.
#### Containers
Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object.
#### Cloud Services
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Cloud 
services are providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud providing these services.
#### Cloud Architecture
Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform, 
back end platforms, a cloud based delivery, and a network. Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture.
#### AWS
Amazon Web Service which is Amazon's cloud computing service.

#### EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
Though EC2/Beanstalk and Heroku seem to do similar jobs they are slightly different. First EC2 is a Infrastructure as a Servce (IaaS) which allows to host an operating system 
on cloud. However, Elastic Beanstalke and Heroku both are PaaS or platform as a Service. The difference between the two rely on services and price. Heroku tends to have a steeper
price range. But it automatically manages, the Dynos and Heroku Postgres resources. It has an easier learning curve as most of the work is done through it's services.  
On the other hand, AWS' Beanstalk is slightly more complicated but has a more linear price range. Also, being part of the AWS infrastructure is easily integrated with other AWS
services.
