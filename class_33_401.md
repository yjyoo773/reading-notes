### Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()
#### useMemo()
Returns a memoized value.  
Pass a “create” function and an array of dependencies. `useMemo` will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization 
helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render.
#### useReducer()
An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. `useReducer` is usually 
preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. `useReducer` also lets you 
optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

### Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
The hooks name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

### What do custom hooks usually do?
Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic, but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.

### Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
Something that was a requirement from this week's lab was to update to document title accordingly. I was able to find a custom hook that does the same functionality.
```JavaScript
const useDocumentTitle = title => {
  useEffect(
    () => {
      document.title = title
    },
    [title
  )
};
```

### Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
```JavaScript
import { useState, useRef } from 'react'
const useFetch = url => {
  const cache = useRef({})
  const [status,setStatus] = useState('idle')
  const [data, setData] = useState([])
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!url) return;
    const fetchData = async () => {
      setStatus('fetching');
      if(cahce.current[url]) {
        const data = cache.current[url];
        setData(data)
        setStatus('fetched')
      } else {
        const response = await fetch(url)
        const data = await response.json()
        cache.current[url] = data
        setData(data)
        setStatus('fetched')
      }
    }
    fetchData();
  },[url])
  return {status, data}
}
```

### reducer
Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method
