# AWS: Events

### Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

Combining AWS API Gateway with Lambda functions are similar to Express JS in the way that it can create an RESTful API. API Gateway takes care of handling the routes as
`express.Router` would and the Lambda functions handle can take care of the CRUD actions that express does.

### List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
AWS has a total of 8 database services
- RDS: This is a relational database that is similat to SQL
- DynamoDB: Similar to NoSQL and MongoDB
- Elasticache: Caches data in cloud
- Neptune
- Amazon QLDB
- Amazon DocumentDB
- Amazon Keyspace
- Amazon Timestream

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once.  
FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it. 
Duplicates are not introduced into the queue.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

Using a status code on whether the message was properly received, the server can detect if the message was failed or not. Using that, it can retry sending the same 
message deduplication id.

#### Serverless API
Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application 
runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider.
#### Triggers
A trigger is a Lambda resource or a resource in another service that you configure to invoke your function in response to lifecycle events, external requests, 
or on a schedule.
#### Dynamo vs Mongo
- AWS vs Open source
- Managed by AWS vs Self install / use MongoDB Atlas
- Use tables vs JSON-like document
- Limited data types and smaller item size vs More data type and less restriction

#### Dynamoose vs Mongoose
Dynamoose is a modeling tool for DynamoDB inspired by Mongoose
