# Event Driven Architecture

### Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
A standard queue provides at least-once-delivery meaning each message is delievered at least once. Where as a FIFO queue provides exactly-once 
processing, which meanst that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processit and deletes it.

### How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
Using a status code on whether the message was properly received, the server can detect if the message was failed or not. Using that, it can
retry sending the sam message deduplication id.

### What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
Observer Pattern

### How do you test an event driven system?
- Logging each event based on the application behavior, and timestamp.
- Distributed tracing which is to monitor the complete activity path of a transaction throughout the entire system.
- Unit tests

### FIFO Queue
FIFO (First-in First-Out) queues are designed for applications where the order of events is critical or where de-duplication of messages is required.
### Pub/Sub
Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.You can use 
Pub/Sub as messaging-oriented middleware or event ingestion and delivery for streaming analytics pipelines.
