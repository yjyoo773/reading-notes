# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

### What are serverless functions?
Serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the 
Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies. The benefits of serverless functions are autoscaling and redundant code deployments. Serverless
function code are stateless logic, hence redundant instances do not cause redundancies for customers.

### If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
To my understanding, Lambda functions are similar to socket.io. Hosted on an http it works as an event listener which listens to triggers. Once that trigger is spun up, 
Lambda initiates the function which may trigger another function or event. Also, it incorporates a data storage such as S3 to hold code that are too big due to dependencies. 
So something to store the code may also be needed. Or, it can find a way of installing the dependencies within the system with the given package.json.

### Describe how a CDN works
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. The popularity 
of CDN services continues to grow, and today the majority of web traffic is served through CDNs, including traffic from major sites like Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon. 
The benefits of CDN relies on improving website loadtimes, reducing bandwidth costs, increasing content availability and redundancy, and improving website security.

It delivers webpages and webcontent based on the geographic location of the user, origin of webpage, and content delivery server. When a user requests a website or data where 
the origin is from a distant location the content is cached in a edge location for a given time. Within that given time if a different user requests the same data the edge 
location that has it cached can send it right away. This saves time foe the second user.

### Cloud Storage
Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service.
