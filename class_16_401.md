# AWS: Cloud Servers

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
A WRRC is a cycle in which a user creates a request through the browser. In doing so the browser sends that request to the appropriate server based on the route. The server then 
gives a response accordingly sending it back to the browser for the user to see.

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
A server is a hardware or software which provides functionality for other programs or devices called _clients_. This relates to the WRRC as the user who creates a request is the
client and the response giver is the server. This also relates to **cloud servers** as well. A cloud server is a pooled, centralized server resource that is hosted and delivered over
a network (mostly the internet) and accessed on demand by multiple users. It provides the same functionality as physical servers but can be located anywhere in the world deliverying
services remotely through a cloud computing environment. The well known ones are Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform.

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Deploying an application means to run it on a server or device. By deploying, the application would work on a target device, whether it be a test server, production environment,
 or a user's computer / smart phone.
 
#### Server
A server is a hardware or software which provides functionality for other programs or devices called _clients_.
#### Pub / Sub
Publish and subscribe are a process of event handling. Publishing emits the event whether it sends data or creates another event. Whereas subscribing listens to the event and
reacts accordingly.

#### WRRC
WRRC is the web request response cycle which the way information flows through the system. First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information 
(or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the 
requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
