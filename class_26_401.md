## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways. The technical difference 
between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when 
and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the 
code you plugged in as needed.

### Rendering
Rendering is a process that is triggered by a change of state in some component of your application, when a state change occurs React. The purpose of rendering is to 
display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
### Templates
Template (file format), a standardized non-executable file type used by computer software as a pre-formatted example on which to base other files, especially documents.
### State
State in React is a plain JavaScript object. It holds information that influences the output of render and is managed within the component. The state starts with a default 
value when a Component mounts and then suffers from mutations in time (mostly generated from user events). It's a serializable* representation of one point in time—a snapshot.
