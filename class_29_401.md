### Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
Yes, child components have direct access to props/state passed from the parent component.

### When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
The child component will be rendered where it is being rendered within the parent component. 
```JavaScript
class Parent extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div className = "wrapper">
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        {this.props.child}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <p>{this.props.body}</p>      
    )
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <>
        <Parent title="this is parent"}>
          <Child body="this is child/>
        </Parent>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```
The following code above produces this markup
```
<div class="wrapper">
  <h1>this is parent</h1>
  <p>this is child</p>
</div>

```

### Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
```
<Main>
 <Content/>
</<Main
```
Yes. child components such as `<Content/>` can be used as stand alone components elsewhere. Using the example above,
```JavaScript
class App extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
          <Child body="this is child/>
    )
  }
}
```
this would simply produce
```
 <p>this is child</p>
```

### What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
When using a functional component this can be done by using `...`. For instance `<Child {...props}>`. As for class components simply add `this.props`.

### props.children
Allows components that do not know children that are created later to let other components pass arbitrary children to the by nesting the JSX.
### composition
Composition is the design technique in object-oriented programming to implement has-a relationship between objects. Composition in java is achieved by using instance 
variables of other objects.
