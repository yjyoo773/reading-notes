# Class Note 1

## Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
`Array.map()` is a function associated with JavaScript. By putting in a function within the parameters, `Array.map()` will create a new array accordingly to the inputted function.
The new array will have the same length as the previous one and will not add or remove any elements within the array.

## Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
`Array.reduce()` reduces the array to a single output value based on the user's reducer function provided. The function takes 4 arguments.
- Accumulator
- Current Value
- Current Index
- Source Array  

```JavaScript
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array) {
  return accumulator + currentValue
}) \\ 10
```
If a starting value is provided the `accumulator` will equal to the that starting value and the `currentValue` will equal to the first value of the array. When the starting
value is not provided, the `accumulator` equals to the first value of the array and the `currentValue` will equal to the second value of the array.

## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

### With normal Promise .then() syntax
```JavaScript
let superagent = require('superagent')

let url = 'http://someSortOfUrl.com'
superagent
.get(url)
.then(result => console.log(result.body))
.catch(err => err.message)
```

### With async / await syntax
```JavaScript
let superagent = require('superagent')

let url = 'http://someSortOfUrl.com'
let getData = async()=>{
  try{
    let results = await superagent.get(url)
    console.log(results.body)
  } catch(err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}
```

## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
In order to understand `Promises` we first need to understand of asynchronous. It is a concept when building code, the program is asked to perform a task alongside the original
task without stopping to wait for the task to be finished. When the secondary task is finished, the primary task is notified the work is done along with any of the results
available. So `Promises` deal with asynchronous code such that callbacks do not get mixed up. `Promises` can and will be in one of the three steps `pending`, `resolved`, or `rejected`.
When the `promise` is called, it becomes in a `pending` state. Meaning the calling function continues executing while the `promise` is pending until it gets resolved.  
The `promise` will eventually become either `resolved` or `rejected` calling the respective callback functions(passed to `then` and `catch`). Using resolve and reject, we can
communicate back to the caller what the resulting promise state was, and what to do with it.

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
Callback functions are functions called within a function. For example, let `alpha` and `beta` be a function. Then, `beta` in `alpha(beta)`would become a callback function. So 
when `alpha` is called the function `beta` will also be executed.  
Now to answer the question if callback functions are Asynchronous, it depends on which function is returned first. If `alpha` from the previos example is returned first and then
`beta` is executed the callback function is asynchronous.  
However, if `alpha` is returned after `beta` is executed the function is synchronous. Functions that are synchronous are `Array.forEach()`, `Array.map()`, `Array.filter()`, and
so on. 
```JavaScript
var available = false;
[1,2,3].forEach( function(){
    available = true;
});
//code here runs after the whole .forEach has run,
//so available === true here
```
