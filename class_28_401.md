# Component Composition

### Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
Yes, this can be done through Refs. In the parent component's constructor by adding `this.childRef=React.createRef()` and passing this into the child component the parent 
compenent can access the state of the child component.

### What can be passed along in a prop variable?
Any sort of data can be passed through props.

### How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
A child component "knows" the state of another state through the props that it is being passed down. However, it would not know if the data being passed down is a state or another
state.

### component props
Props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters)
### component state
State is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function)
### application state
Application state is the "global" state that all components in the component tree can access, through cursors
