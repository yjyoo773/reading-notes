# Props and State

### Does a deployed React application require a server?
No a deployed React application does not need a server.

### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
React being used to create a front end UI, it is better to test the application using behavior driven development. When developing a React application each functionality maybe 
important. However, being a UI it is possible to create a more user friendly application using behvaioral driven test which containts context or the starting state. Followed by 
the event which is what the user does and the outcome being the expected result.

### What does `npm run build` do?
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
- The entry point starts with `index.js` and `index.html`.
- `App.js` is usually the main file containing all of the other components that build up the application.
- The application itself is a single page application

### BDD
Behaviour driven development is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software
project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave.

### Acceptance Tests
ACCEPTANCE TESTING is a level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the business 
requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery

### mounting
"Mounting" is when React "renders" the component for the first time and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions.

### build
Creates a production build or the appliication that is minified for performance and benchmarking.
