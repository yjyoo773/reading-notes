### What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
Packets are the basic units of communication over a TCP/IP network. By transforming the data into small pieces this allows 
- network to accommodate various bandwidths
- allow multiple routes to a destinations
- retransmit pieces of data which are interrupted/lost

### UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
 UDP or User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless protocol designed to stream data. It has no beginning, middle, or end to the conversation. Meaning data simply flows
 between the two systems that are connected. This being said UDP is a simple protocol when speed is an issue.
 
### Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
A server socket listens only on a single port. So all established client conncections on that server are associated with that same listening port on the server side. However,
multiple TCP sockets can be connected using that port for sending and recieving data.

### Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
This can be done by using on socket per server.

### Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
Yes it is possible by connecting to multiple socket servers using different ports.

#### Observer Pattern
A software design pattern used whne *observers* listen to changes in state and calling one of its method. Usually used in event handling systems
#### Listener
An event listeners can be part of the observer pattern which *listens* for change in the state
#### Event Handler
The event handler is called once the listener notices change which is when the handler is called
#### Event Driven Programming
A programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events (mostly from user actions, sensor outputs, or message passing)
#### Event Loop
A programming contsruct or design pattern that waits and dispatches events or messages in a program. By making a request to some "event provider" then calls the
relevant event handler.
#### Event Queue
An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in 
the context of an enterprise messaging system.
#### Call Stack
A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple 
functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
#### Emit/Raise/Trigger
The `.emit` triggers the event in Node.js
#### Subscribe
To *listen* to something regularly.
#### database
A data structure that stores organized information.
