# Redux Additional Topics

### What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

Best practice for pre-loading data into the store in a Redux application is to use one of the life-cycle methods `componentDidMount` or `useEffect`. Once it is loaded it needs to
 be handled with a reducer into the app store.

### When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

The async action is exported which dispatches the action that is meant to be dispatched.

### middleware
Function that takes in a request, changes the request accordingly and passes next.

### thunk
A middleware that is used to handle asynchronus actions.
