# Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion
### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- Middleware can be used for distributed processing with actions occuring in real time rather than sending data back and forth
- Middleware can be used as messaging services such that different applications can communicate among one another if each use different messaging framworks such as REST, SOAP, and JSON
- Middleware can be used as a proxy to conceal authentication servers' URL.
### True or false: The route handler is middleware?
A route handler is code that is looking for a request to a specific incoming URL. Specific HTTP verb such as `POST` has specific code for handling that url.
However, in Express:
```
app.use()
app.get()
app.post()
app.put()
app.delete()
app.all()
```
are used as handling routes which can also be used for middleware. Hence, yes route handlers can be considered middleware.
### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response
