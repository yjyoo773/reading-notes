# Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion
### Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- Middleware can be used for distributed processing with actions occuring in real time rather than sending data back and forth
- Middleware can be used as messaging services such that different applications can communicate among one another if each use different messaging framworks such as REST, SOAP, and JSON
- Middleware can be used as a proxy to conceal authentication servers' URL.
### True or false: The route handler is middleware?
A route handler is code that is looking for a request to a specific incoming URL. Specific HTTP verb such as `POST` has specific code for handling that url.
However, in Express:
```
app.use()
app.get()
app.post()
app.put()
app.delete()
app.all()
```
are used as handling routes which can also be used for middleware. Hence, yes route handlers can be considered middleware.
### In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
The middleware function can end the process and send the data to the browser when `next()` is not called but calls `res.end`,`res.send`,`res.render` or any sort of method that
calls `res.end`.
```JavaScript
app.use(function (req,res,next){
  if(/* end process here */){
    res.end();
  } else {
    next()
  }
})
```
### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
The following image gives a good iea of when the middleware is "injected". It is inbetween the request and the response.

### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response"
This can occur when the respsones headers are set more than once in the same handler. For instance, running `res.render` and `res.json` in the same handler can cause this error.
Other methods that set response headers are:
- `res.send`
- `res.json`
- `res.render`
- `res.sendFile`
- `res.sendStatus`
- `res.end`
- `res.redirect`

### Vocab Terms
#### Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
#### Request Object
The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. In this documentation and by convention, the object is always referred to as req (and the HTTP response is res) but its actual name is determined by the parameters to the callback function in which you’re working.
#### Response Object
The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
#### Application Middleware
Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()` functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.
#### Routing Middleware
Routing middlewares are those that are used to that specific route. Unlike application middleware which has a greater scope.
#### Test Driven Development
Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases
#### Behavioral Testing
Behavior-driven development is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project.

### Preview
1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?  
I am getting a better grasp on middleware and how it can be used. I get the idea of TDD, BDT, BDD but am still unsure how to progress with it.
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?  
As said above, knowing how to progress with TDD, BDT, and BDD is hard to grasp at the moment.
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?  
Reaading over express routing, I am willing to know how it will change how I have been creating server routes from here on.
