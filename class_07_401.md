# Bearer Authorization

### Write the following steps in the correct order
<!--Not sure of the following steps -->
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
4. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Receive authorization code

### What can you do with an authorization code?
An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space. 
An authorization code is typically a sequence of letters, numbers, or a combination of both, that validates a person's identity, approves a transaction or 
provides access to a secured area. It is most commonly used to when being sent to a merchant from a credit card company to confirm the customer's credit card has sufficient
credit to authorize a transaction.  

### What can you do with an access token?
Access tokens are used in token-based authentication to allow an application to access an API. The application receives an access token after a user successfully 
authenticates and authorizes access, then passes the access token as a credential when it calls the target API. The passed token informs the API that the bearer of the 
token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions specified by the scope that was granted during authorization.

### What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard protocol that allows organizations to authenticate user data across applications. Hence, it is easier to login for different applications and
is secure. It is easy to implement and provides strong authentication.

## Vocab
### Client ID
The client_id is a public identifier for apps. Even though it’s public, it’s best that it isn’t guessable by third parties, so many implementations use something like 
a 32-character hex string. It must also be unique across all clients that the authorization server handles.
### Client Secret
The client_secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It must be sufficiently random to not be guessable, which means you should 
avoid using common UUID libraries which often take into account the timestamp or MAC address of the server generating it.
### Authentication Endpoint
URLs that you use to make authentication requests.
### Access Token Endpoint
The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. 
### API Endpoint
An API endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting.  It refers to touchpoints of the communication between 
an API and a server. The endpoint can be viewed as the means from which the API can access the resources they need from a server to perform their task. 
### Authorization Code
An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space. 
### Access Token
Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application 
to access specific parts of a user’s data.
