# Hooks API

### Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
This is due to the fact that React appliactions are a Single Page Application. So everything is within the index.html. However, it can be designed to look like it has multiple 
pages by rendering the requested parts only.
### If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
- Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
- Inside a <Route />
In order to have a component to show in every page we would place it within <BrowserRouter /> and outside of <Route />. The <BrowserRouter /> wraps the entire application 
where as everything within a <Route /> is only shown on that specific route.
### What does props.children contain?
`props.children` contains whatever it being passed on from the parent. This can be a single data, many or none.

### Composition
Composition is the design technique in object-oriented programming to implement has-a relationship between objects. Composition in java is achieved by using instance 
variables of other objects
### Children / Child Components
Children components allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use. The special thing about children is that React provides 
support through its ReactElement API and JSX. 
### Hash Routing
What we meant by hash-based routing is using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content. For example `http://site.com/#/products/list` leads to displaying a 
list of products. We have to mention that the #/products/list bit is never sent to the server. and we are completely operating in the client-side. The routing is possible 
because changes in the hash donâ€™t trigger page reload.
### Link Routing
Link-state routing is that every node constructs a map of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are connected to which other nodes. Each 
node then independently calculates the next best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network.
