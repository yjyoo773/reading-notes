# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

### How granular should your reducers be?
Prefer having more UI components subscribed to the Redux store and reading data at a more granular level. This typically leads to better UI performance, as fewer components 
will need to render when a given piece of state changes.

### Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
This can either be a con or pro based on how descriptive the action is named. There can be instances where the action is fired unintendedly based on a common name. However, if 
the intention is to fire multiple specific reducers, through well designed and named actions it is a pro.

### Name a strategy for preventing the above
As said above, by setting the action name as specific as possible rather than a common name is essential. And to specifically name the actions that should be fired together with 
the same name. 


### store
A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it. A store is not a class. It's just an object 
with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

### combined reducers
The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore. The resulting 
reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under 
their keys as passed to combineReducers().
